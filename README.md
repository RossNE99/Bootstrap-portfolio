# Ross Charlton - Bootstrap - Web development portfolio 🚀

## Description
This repository showcases my web development portfolio using Bootstrap, as a testament to my skills in the dynamic field of web development. Crafted with a mission to highlight my expertise, it serves as a vital asset in today's competitive market.

The main aim of this GitHub project is to use Bootstrap to improve on [previous portfolio](https://github.com/RossNE99/HTML-CSS-portfolio). The motivation behind this project was to recreate my portfolio and retain the functionality and with thanks to the use of Bootstrap the code in this project should be a lot cleaner and give an overall, more professional look to the site. 

The problem with vanilla CSS is that it requires everything to be written from scratch, you have to create all your utility classes from scratch, doing this creates a lot of boilerplate code which also wastes a lot of time. Bootstrap is the answer to this as bootstrap provides a good range of useful utility classes which can be used throughout your code, as many times as you want! Not only that but it also has pre made components to use such as; Navbar, Cards, Jumbotron and Forms etc. By utilising bootstrap I have halved my CSS file in length compared to my original portfolio.
